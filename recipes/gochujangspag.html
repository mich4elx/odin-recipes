    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, diced</li> 
        <li>2 garlic cloves, pressed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup gochujang red chile paste</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>       
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until tender with a bite, about 12 minutes. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water; set aside. Drain spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef, bell pepper, and onion together in a large skillet, until meat and vegetables are browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Drain any excess grease and discard.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and gochujang to meat, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring constantly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add heavy whipping cream, and cook and stir until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add cooked spaghetti to meat mixture; stir in Parmesan cheese. If sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water, 2 tablespoons at a time, to thin to desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>
